This code solves the visibility windows between satellites in a constellation for a given period of time. If there is direct line of sight, a pair of satellites can establish connection. If the Earth (or any other celestial object) is in between, they can't. Also provides the shortest path between two given satellites (sender and recevier) of the constellation.

The input is TLE (two line elements).
